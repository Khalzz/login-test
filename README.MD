# Login-test

This is a basic Login with vanilla PHP... that's it...

## Install

The project was made with Xampp, so you can have the database and the server on the same place, with Xampp already installed you should:

1. Go to your Xampp's installation folder: `<Xampp folder>/htdocs/` and there you put the file you have downloaded.
2. Press `Start` on the **MySql** server option on Xampp.
3. Press `Admin` on the **MySql** option and you will open **PHPMyAdmin**.
4. On the page press `import` and upload `DB.sql` on the folder `DB`.
5. With this ready, press `Start` on the **Apache** setting of Xampp.
6. Finally search on your browser the next url: **`http://localhost/login-test/`** and then, use the system.
